	Provided in this Visual Studio solution is a Vulkan implementation
	of a forward shading renderer. This should build and run on the MSc
	lab windows machines equipped with the Vulkan SDK. Controls are as follows
	
		w      - move camera forward
		s      - move camera backwards
		a      - move camera left
		d      - move camera right
		q      - move camera up
		e      - move camera down
		
		f      - regenerate shading materials
	
		space  - pause light animation
